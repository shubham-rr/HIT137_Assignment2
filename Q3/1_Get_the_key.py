# fixing this code will reveal the key:

for i in range(5):
    for j in range(3):
        if i + j == 5:
            total += i + j
        else:
            total -= i - j # might lead to a negative value

counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    if total < 13:
        total += 1
    elif total > 13:
        total -= 1
    else:
        counter += 2 # this while loop might terminate early if counter += 2
        
# Total will always remain at 13 to my understanding, so i guess the key will be 13
