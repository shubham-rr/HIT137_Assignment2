which can be better evaluated by standard pa and lateral chest films when condition permits chest ct no juxtatracheal mass or left upper lobe lesion as questioned on chest radiograph report three foci of ground glass right upper lobe not detectable on routine radiographs a nonspecific finding six month ct follow up is recommended to look for change because bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma though unlikely cannot be excluded borderline size mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes should be checked on followup ct mild atherosclerotic coronary artery calcification chest cta no pulmonary embolism relatively unchanged appearance of multiple ill defined opacities and tiny nodules in the right upper lobe follow up stated on the examination from day prior is again recommended new foci of opacification present at the lung bases compared to examination from one day prior likely related to aspiration layering debris present within the right main stem bronchus most suggestive of aspiration as well clinical correlation is recommended recommend advancing ng tube at least cm the current position elevates the risk of further aspiration ct rle with contrast impression comminuted

fragment ct lle without contrast comminuted left calcaneal fracture lentiform area of fluid attenuation at the skin on the posterolateral aspect of the left foot the significance of the latter finding is uncertain but may be due to a skin blister or possibly dressing material within the cast clinical correlation requested cxr ng tube could be advanced several centimeters for standard positioning as

effusion impression normal global and regional biventricular systolic function brief hospitalhospital course during course of hospitalization pt was put on ciwa scale for etoh withdrawal and given thiamine folate and a multivitamin his afib with rvr was initially treated with metoprolol then diltiazem his high ammonia levels were treated with lactulose his b l ankle fractures were followed by orthopedics the patient was severely agitated on more than one occassion during this hospitalization requiring three codes puples to be called as well as requiring restraints for protection of both the patient and the staff the patient was originally sent from the floor to the micu with delirium of unknown cause and severe agititation he required increased amounts of sedation and was returned to the floor after a ng tube was placed once returned to the floor the patient required less sedation was taken off of any benzodiazipines and only intermittently needed restraints the patient remained somnolent and delerious he pulled out his ng tube he was also febrile and rhoncorous on the floor he was initially treated with vancomycin and flagyl which was changed to azithro ceftriaxone flagyl he was scheduled to return to the or for revision of his right external fixation in preop holding he was found to be hypoxic and sent to the micu micu course morning of patient scheduled to return to or for revision of externally fixated rle upon transport to pacu patient became more somnolent and had reported agonal breathing o sats on lnc and nrb applied with o sats to bp in s s hr in s rr abg drawn during stay in micu patient coughed up large amount of thick sputum with improved respiratory status surgery postponed and patient transferred to micu for further monitoring in the micu respiratory status has remained stable with sp in the high s on room air pt is hemodynamically stable in chronic a flutter called out to floor on no further intensive care needs identified in the micu patient was started on zosyn and restarted on vancomycin wiht marked improvement in his respiratory status within a few days of returning to the floor vancomycin and zosyn were stopped as cxr showed resolution of questionable aspiration pneumonia this was felt to be more likely pneuomonitis which resolved after the micu patients delirium started to improve but then worsened when he returned to the or for removal of external fixation he developed fevers to f post operatively which likely worsened delirium source of fevers unclear of note patient had recently developed vre in his urine but infectious disease did not feel this was an active infection he received three days of antibiotics daptomycin and then linezolid when these were stopped he became afebrile and delirium began to lift aggitation was mostly controlled with haldol zyprexa was tried for two weeks but it did not seem to help acute aggitation qtc was monitored while patient was on antipsychotics and was stable at approximately msec overall etiology of delirium has remained unclear but was thought to be multifactorial due in part to chronic alcohol use hepatic encephalopathy benzodiazepine use and post operative delririum although spanish speaking sitters and interpreters were employed as much as possible language also likely contributed to persistance of delirium delirium has completely resolved patient is now restraint and sitter free all haldol has been stopped he has past the period of etoh withdrawal it is recommended that patient follow up with alcohol abuse counseling afib flutter while febrile his afib flutter was complicated by more frequent episodes of rapid ventricular rate this was controlled with iv metoprolol when needed but also by increasing po metoprolol and diltiazem treating fever with tylenol also seemed to help he was briefly put on therapeutic lovenox for atrial fibrillation but this was stopped as he was not felt to be eligible by chads criteria and also because of high fall risk patient was transitioned off of beta blockers and placed on diltiazem mg daily urinary retention patient failed several voiding trials he also pulled out his foley on several occasions causing hematuria intermittent straight catheterization was tried to reduce infection risk of long term indwelling foley however given delirium and aggitation this was untenable this resolved with reductions in haldol patient now able to void freely on his own history of vre on urine culture but no signs of infection dyruria increased urinary frequency there is no evidence based
